## Story
A band of thieves once gathered at a table in a small tavern. They drank and sang and drank again, until one of them started boasting about his incredible skills.
"You thieves couldn't take a penny from a beggar," he said.
"Ha!" snorted another one, apparently offended. "Says who? Mr. I-rob-old-ladies? None of you are *my* equal!"
A third thief laughed so hard, she almost fell out of her chair. They got into a heated argument, shouting at each other and inventing the grossest of insults. Just when a fight seemed inevitable, the youngest of them managed to attract everyone's attention.
"Calm down, friends, there is no need for blood. Say, we're all betting folk, are we not? How about a wager to settle this once and for all, eh?"
And so it began.

## Introduction
In Among Thieves, you take the role of a thief, trying to prove you're the best in the trade by accumulating the greatest fortune. You will do this by carefully planning street robberies and dangerous heists, but also by setting traps for the others and sabotaging their well-prepared burglaries.

## Gameplay
Each game will follow these three steps: [Setup](#setup) then [Rounds](#rounds) until a thief [Wins](#winning-the-game).

### Setup
Among thieves is a game for 3 to 5 thieves. Before you start the game, the following should be done:
1. Each thief receives a complete set of 5 action cards: One each of [Steal](#steal), [Trap](#trap), [Sabotage](#sabotage), [Heist](#heist), and [No Honor](#no-honor).
2. All the coins are put in the the middle of the table. This is [The City](#the-city) and it represents the wealth of the citizens. Then, each thief steals a coin.
3. The [Heist Locations](#heist-locations) are shuffled and a number of them, equal to the number of thieves minus 2, are placed face down next to **The City** in the middle of the table. The remaining **Heist Locations** are set aside until step 7 of the [Round](#rounds).
4. The title of [Master Thief](#master-thief) goes to whomever snatches the card first!

### Rounds
Among Thieves is a game played in **Rounds**, consisting of the same sequence of steps described below until a thief [Wins the Game](#winning-the-game):
- Select
	1. If it's not the first round, pass the [[Master Thief]] card to the next thief clockwise.
	2. Secretly select two cards from your hand to play this round. Keep them separate from your hand and discard. Put a finger in the air when you have selected your cards.
- Play
	1. The **Master Thief** leads a count of "3-2-1 There's no honor among thieves!" If you selected the [[No Honor]] card, reveal it and point at another thief to rob. Otherwise, put your hand down.
	2. Starting with the **Master Thief**, thieves take turns playing their unrevealed cards. Play proceeds clockwise until until all cards have been revealed.
- Resolve
	1. Resolve [Heist](#heist) cards.
	2. Resolve [No Honor](#no-honor) cards.
- Cleanup
	1. Secretly choose one of the cards you played this **Round** and discard it. Return the other to your hand. If your hand is only one card return all discarded cards to your hand.
	2. Resolved [Heist Locations](#heist-locations) are shuffled into the deck and new ones are drawn to replace them.

### Winning the Game
The game ends when a thief has amassed a fortune of 7 or more coins at the end of a [Round](#rounds). If multiple thieves have 7 or more coins, the thief with the most coins wins. If there is a tie for the largest fortune, the game continues as usual until a clear winner emerges.

## The Cards
To be able to play the game correctly, each thief will need to understand each of these cards:

### Steal

|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/steal.png width=100>|Rob a citizen. If not [Trapped](#trap), immediately take a coin from [The City](#the-city).|
|-|-|



### Trap
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/trap.png width=100>|Foil another thief's attempt to [Steal](#steal) from a citizen. Can be played in two different ways:<ul><li>As an interrupt: When a thief plays **Steal**, proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Trap** and get the thief attempting to **Steal** [Caught](#caught). This does not count as revealing a card for your turn.</li><li>On your turn: You may play **Trap** on your turn by pointing at a thief who hasn't revealed a **Steal** card yet. If that thief plays **Steal** this [Round](#rounds) they are **Caught**.</li></ul>|
|-|-|


### Heist
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/heist-chest.png width=100x136>|Plan out a big, but risky, score! Be wary of [Sabotage](#sabotage). You play **Heist** on your turn and resolve it later in the round.<ol><li>On your turn: Reveal your **Heist** and if not **Sabotaged**, place your **Heist** card on an unclaimed [Heist Location](#heist-locations) to claim it. If all the **Heist Locations** have already been claimed you can replace the **Heist** of a wealthier thief. If you do, they do not resolve their **Heist**.</li><li>Resolution: In the resolution step of the [Round](#rounds), flip the **Heist Location** you placed your **Heist** on face up. If it has coins on the face get that many coins from [The City](#the-city). If it is the [Jail Card](#heist-locations) or if you were **Sabotaged**, you instead get [Caught](#caught).</li></ol>|
|-|-|


### Sabotage
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/sabotage.png width=100>|Throw a wrench in another thief's [Heist](#heist) plans. Can be played in two different ways:<ul><li>As an interrupt: When a thief plays **Heist**, proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Sabotage** and get the thief attempting to **Heist** [Caught](#caught). This does not count as revealing a card for your turn.</li><li>On your turn: You may play **Sabotage** on your turn by pointing to a thief who hasn't revealed a **Heist** card yet. If that thief plays **Heist** this [Round](#rounds) they are **Caught**.</li></ul>|
|-|-|

### No Honor
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/no-honor.png width=100>|The ends justify the means; rob another thief! **No Honor** is played early in the [Round](#rounds), resolved near the end, and always discarded.<ol><li>Play: In step 2 of the **Round**, on the [Master Thief's](#master-thief) count, reveal **No Honor** and point at another thief to rob.</li><li>Resolve: In step 5 of the **Round**, in turn order, starting with the **Master Thief**, each thief who played **No Honor** takes one coin from the thief they pointed at. If the thief you are robbing has 5 coins you take two instead. If the thief you are robbing has played both [Trap](#trap) and [Sabotage](#sabotage) they are an **"Honest Businessperson"**, you are [Caught](#caught), and [The City](#the-city) awards them one coin.</li><li>Discard: If you played this card, you must discard it in step 6 of the **Round**.</li></ol>|
|-|-|


### Master Thief
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/master-thief.png width=100>|Whomever possesses the Master Thief card is the Master Thief. The master thief acts first in many instances. When a thief becomes a master they steal one coin from [The City](#the-city).|
|-|-|


### Heist Locations
|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/coin-1.png width=66>|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/coin-2.png width=66>|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/coin-3.png width=66>|<img src=/var/home/harleydutton/Workspace/among-thieves/images/jail.png width=66>|
|-|-|-|-|

A **Heist  Location** is a face-down card that thieves can attempt to rob using the [Heist](#heist) card. The number of **Heist Locations** is determined in [Setup](#setup). The **Heist Location** deck is the remainder of the **Heist Locations**, shuffled.

## Concepts
The following are abstract concepts rather than physical game components. Each thief will need to understand them in order to play:

### The City
**The City** is the pile or bowl of coins in the center of the table that represents the wealth of the Citizenry. It should contain a maximum of 31 coins.

### Caught
When a thief is **Caught** committing robberies they must bribe the law in order to escape. The thief receives no coins from their robbery and returns one coin to [The City](#the-city), if able.

---
## Additional Rules
- If you don't follow the rules for any reason and are hindered by it, that's just too bad.
- If you don't follow the rules and benefit from it, you're not just a thief -- you're a liar and a cheat! If the other thieves catch you they frame you and the [The City](#the-city) takes all your coins!
- If you would have to pay a coin but don't have any, you get a beating from the constabulary and are just as poor as you were.
- You cannot take blood from a stone -- if you would steal from a thief or **The City** when they have no coins, you get nothing!
