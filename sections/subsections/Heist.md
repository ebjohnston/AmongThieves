You play **Heist** on your turn and resolve it later in the round.<ol><li>On your turn: Reveal your **Heist** and if not **Sabotaged**, place your **Heist** card on an unclaimed [[The Rules#Heist Locations\|Heist Location]] to claim it. If all the **Heist Locations** have already been claimed you can replace the **Heist** of a wealthier thief. If you do, they do not resolve their **Heist**.</li><li>Resolution: In the resolution step of the [[The Rules#Rounds\|Round]], flip the **Heist Location** you placed your **Heist** on face up. If it has coins on the face get that many coins from [[The Rules#The City\|The City]]. If it is the [[The Rules#Heist Locations\|Jail Card]] or if you were **Sabotaged**, you instead get [[The Rules#Caught\|Caught]].</li></ol>|
