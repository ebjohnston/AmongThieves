Before you start the game, the following should be done:
1. Each thief receives a complete set of 5 [[Action Cards]] -- one of each -- [[Steal]], [[Trap]], [[Sabotage]], [[Heist]], and [[No Honor]].
2. All the coins are put in the the middle of the table. They represent the wealth of the citizens of [[The City]]. Then, each thief steals a coin.
4. The [[Heist Locations]] are shuffled and a number of them, equal to the number of thieves minus 2, are placed face down next to the city in the middle of the table. A game of three players should have one Heist Location; four players -- two heist; fivethere's one heist location; four players -- two locations; five players -- 3 locations. The remaining **Heist Locations** are set aside for the round.
5. The title of [[Master Thief]] thief goes to whomever snatches the card first! That opportunistic thief gets an extra coin.
