should [[Winning the Game]] be it's own step of the [[Round]]?

need to redirect links in [[The Rules]] to point to the section headers therein.

define "your turn" as it is used in [[Sabotage]] and [[Trap]].

[[problems]] make it clear that crimes are independent and you can only get [[Caught]] for one crime at a time. it's implicit with heist resolution and sabotage but not with multi-trap or multi-sabotage so the best way to handle this is probably to say you cannot trap/sabotage someone who is already trapped/sabotaged, respectively.

[[problems]] it would be really helpful to have a cheat sheet/reminder card with the steps of the round and a 1-liner on each card. 

[[problems]] A graphic of what each player's play area should look like would be helpful. A reminder card could be used to mark your discard pile. Should discard be face-up or facedown? people don't seem to be having issues with the city or the heist locations.

[[problems]] in playtesting, there seems to be a problem where people don't understand the timing of trap and sabotage. I think allowing sabotage to be played after the fact would solve some of this problem. Steal doesn't seem to be as much of a problem.




how many players can there be in a game?
