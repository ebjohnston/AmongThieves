Among Thieves is a game played in a few **Rounds**, consisting of the same basic steps as described below until some clever and cunning thief [[Winning the Game|wins the game]].
1. Secretly select 2 cards from you hand that you will play this round. Keep them separate from your hand and discard.
2. Lift a finger and count "3-2-1 There's no honor among thieves!" If you selected the [[No Honor]] card, point at another thief to rob. Otherwise, put your hand down.
3. Starting with the [[Master Thief]], thieves take turns revealing a card they chose in step 1 and resolving it's effect. Play proceeds clockwise until until all cards have been revealed.
4. Resolve successful [[Heist|Heists]] and collect rewards.
5. Resolve all [[No Honor]] cards, starting with the [[Master Thief]] and proceeding clockwise.
6. Each thief secretly chooses one of the cards they played this **Round** and discards it face down and returns the other to their hand. Then, if a thief only has one card in hand they return all discarded cards to their hand.
7. Resolved [[Heist Locations]] are shuffled into the deck and new ones are drawn to replace the missing ones.
8. The current [[Master Thief]] passes the [[master-thief.png|Master Thief Card]] to the next thief clockwise. Then, the next round begins.
