When a thief is **Caught** committing robberies they must bribe jailer or constabulary of [[The City]]. They do not get any rewards for their failed robbery and must instead give **The City** one coin, if able. This can result from the [[Jail Card.png|Jail Heist Location]], or another thief's [[Trap]] or [[Sabotage]].
