[[Trap Card.png]]: Can be played in two different ways:
- Interrupt: when a player reveals the [[Steal]] card, each player, starting from the one to his left me play trap to prevent him from stealing. Whether he should do it or not is purely optional, but having chosen, he cannot change his mind.
- On your turn: Then you play trap on your turn you point at a player who hasn't revealed a Steal card yet. If he does play the steal card, no matter if it's his first or second action, he's caught and he must bribe the police with a coin, if able. The coin is returned to the city.
