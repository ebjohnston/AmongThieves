|![[trap.png\|125]]|Foil a petty theft. Can be played in two different ways:<ul><li>As an interrupt: When a thief plays [[Steal]], proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play **Trap** and get the thief attempting to **Steal** [[Caught]]. This does not count as revealing a card for your turn.</li><li>On your turn: You may play **Trap** on your turn by pointing at a thief who hasn't revealed a **Steal** card yet. If that thief plays **Steal** this [[Round]] they are immediately **Caught**.</li></ul>|
