To be able to play the game correctly, each thief will need to understand these each of these cards:

![[Steal]]

---
![[Trap]]

---
![[Heist]]

---
![[Sabotage]]

---
![[No Honor]]

---
![[Master Thief]]
[[problems]] I think I would like to delete this page and directly link each card in [[The Rules]] so each card can be jumped to with a link to a heading.
