Before you start the game, the following should be done:
1. Each player receives a complete set of 5 action cards -- one of each -- Steal, Trap, Sabotage, Heist, and No Honor.
2. The coin tokens are put in the middle of the table. They represent the City, each coin being one citizen -- a potential victim of robbery. Then, all players take one coin -- their starting money.
3. The heist location cards are shuffled and a number of them, equal to the number of players minus 2, are taken from the top and put in the middle of the table, next to the city. So in a game of three players there's one heist location; four players -- two locations; five players -- 3 locations. The remaining cards are set aside.
4. The acting master thief marker is assigned to the player who snatches it first! He gets an extra coin.
