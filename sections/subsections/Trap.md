[[Trap Card.png|Trap Card]]: Foil a petty theft. Can be played in two different ways:
- As an Interrupt: When a thief plays [[Steal|Steals]], proceeding clockwise from the thief playing it, each other thief will have a chance to play [[Trap]] and the stealing thief is [[Caught]]. This does not count as revealing a card for your turn.
- On your turn: You may play [[Trap]]  on your turn by pointing at a player who hasn't revealed a **Steal** card yet. If that thief plays **Steal** at any point they are immediately [[Caught]].
