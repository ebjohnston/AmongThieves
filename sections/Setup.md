2. All the coins are put in the the middle of the table. This is [[Among Thieves Rules#The City|The City]] and it represents the wealth of the citizens. Then, each thief steals a coin.
3. The [[Among Thieves Rules#Heist Locations|Heist Locations]] are shuffled and a number of them, equal to the number of thieves minus 2, are placed face down next to **The City** in the middle of the table.
