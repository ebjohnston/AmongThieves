- If you don't follow the rules for any reason and are hindered by it, that's just too bad.
- If you don't follow the rules and benefit from it, you're not just a thief[[problems for later|;]] you're a liar and a cheat!
- If the other thieves catch you breaking the rules they frame you and you lose all your coins!
- If you would have to pay a coin but don't have any, you get a beating from the constabulary and are just as poor as you were.
