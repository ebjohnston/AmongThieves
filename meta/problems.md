this page holds makes back-links visible for things that are (or I think are going to be) problems


should [[Winning the Game]] be it's own step of the [[Round]]?

need to redirect links in [[The Rules]] to point to the section headers therein.

define "your turn" as it is used in [[Sabotage]] and [[Trap]].

[[problems]] make it clear that crimes are independent and you can only get [[Caught]] for one crime at a time. it's implicit with heist resolution and sabotage but not with multi-trap or multi-sabotage so the best way to handle this is probably to say you cannot trap/sabotage someone who is already trapped/sabotaged, respectively.
